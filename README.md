\#openingweek
=============
In response to Twitter #music, I wanted to create my own version but based around movies and their cast/crew all connected with Twitter. I shipped the very first version 36 hours after Twitter #music was released.

# APIs
In the process, I've learned to make my own personal API's using PHP and additional APIs from various sources.

## Rotten Tomatoes API
The Rotten Tomatoes API is used to grab information about the opening movies, their poster image, synopsis, and cast names.

## Twitter API
I've modified the Twitter API to give me the ability to search for names. Twitter is also used to fetch the latest Tweets related to the movie.

# To-Do
- [x] Add the current week's Friday date.
- Use a different API for obtaining higher resolution posters. Rotten Tomatoes API for posters doesn't have an inbetween size from medium to original.
- [x] RT logo would duplicate once in a while on casts.
- Obtain a larger list of cast members to grab Twitter handles from.
